## What is a Progressive Web App (PWA)?

RemoteIQ is delivered as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**. This means it is a website that "progresses" into a full app experience once you save it to your home screen.

### Benefits vs. Native Apps
1.  **Instant Access**: No need to search the App Store or Google Play. Just visit the URL and you're ready to go.
2.  **Always Up-to-Date**: You never have to manually download an "update." The app refreshes itself every time you open it.
3.  **Low Storage**: PWAs take up significantly less space on your phone than traditional apps.
4.  **Cross-Platform**: The same app works perfectly on iPhone, Android, and Desktop.

### A Native App Experience
Despite being web-based, RemoteIQ feels exactly like a native app:
*   **Home Screen Icon**: Launch it directly from your home screen just like Instagram or Maps.
*   **Full Screen**: Once installed, the browser address bar and navigation buttons disappear, giving you a full-screen experience.
*   **Speed**: Built-in caching ensures the app loads instantly, even on slower connections.

*RemoteIQ sits right alongside your other favorite apps.*
